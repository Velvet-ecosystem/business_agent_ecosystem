# Velvet Autonomous Business Agent Ecosystem

Offline-first, multi-agent business operations built around a strict separation of reasoning, authority, execution, and receipts.

> Brain proposes. Court authorizes. Agents coordinate. Executors act. Receipts remember.

## Purpose

This repository defines a reusable Velvet-style business autonomy framework for workshops, field services, inventory businesses, client operations, scheduling, invoicing, maintenance, and related business systems.

Agents reason and coordinate. They do not directly control business systems.

Executors perform one approved, bounded operation after identity, intent, policy, and safety checks succeed.

## Architecture

```text
human and business inputs
  -> Velvet Autonomy Gateway
  -> identity and intent schema
  -> Court policy gate
  -> safety check
  -> approved executor
  -> receipt log
```

See [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) and [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

## Status

Early architecture and contract skeleton. Private while the core framework is established.
